# wines
I explore data related to the wonderful world of wines. The data are from "Modeling Wine Preferences" by Cortez et al, the publication and the original data are in this directory.
The two files worth looking at the the Wine Presentation notebook, which shows some basic analysis of the wine data, and the Classification notebook, which shows my attempts
to predict wine quality as either good or bad with various models.
